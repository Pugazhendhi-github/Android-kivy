# Simple Android Login Authentication App using Kivy and SQLite
This README provides instructions for setting up and understanding a basic Android login authentication app built using Kivy and SQLite. The app allows users to log in with their credentials and validates them against stored data in an SQLite database.

# Features
Login Screen: Users can enter their username and password.
Validation: The app checks if the entered credentials match the data stored in the SQLite database.
Registration (Optional): Users can register by creating a new account.
Technologies Used
Kivy: A Python framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
SQLite: A lightweight, embedded database system for storing user data.
Folder Structure
Your project folder should have the following structure:

# android-login-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ android-login.kv
â”œâ”€â”€ database.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ README.md

main.py: Contains the main application logic.
android-login.kv: Kivy language file for UI design.
database.py: Handles SQLite database operations.
requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.
README.md: This file.
# Getting Started
Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install Kivy using pip install kivy.
Database Setup:
Create an SQLite database (e.g., users.db) with a users table containing columns for username and password.
Insert sample user data for testing.
Run the App:
Open main.py and configure the database connection.
Run the app using python main.py.
UI Design:
Customize the UI in main.kv. Define the login screen layout, buttons, labels, etc.
Authentication Logic:
In main.py, implement the logic to validate user credentials against the database.
Handle login success or failure accordingly.
Deployment
Deploy your Android app to a device or emulator using Kivyâ€™s build tools. Refer to the Kivy documentation for detailed instructions.
